A: NeoCity Academy is a highly selective public magnet school located in Kissimmee, Florida. We serve students from grades nine through twelve. Our school focuses on inquiry-driven, project-based STEM education. We offer a comprehensive curriculum that includes courses in digital arts, English, mathematics, science, social studies, and world languages. We also have three specialized pathways: artificial intelligence, biodesign, and engineering. Our small class sizes and competitive nature help foster a strong sense of community and academic excellence. We use standards-based grading to ensure student proficiency and offer support services for students with learning differences. Although we do not offer traditional athletic programs, students have the option to participate in athletics at nearby Gateway High School or their home-zoned school. Our mission is to develop students who believe they can make a positive impact on the world.12:48:01 AM
