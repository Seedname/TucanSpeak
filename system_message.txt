STANDARDS BASED GRADINT AT NEOCITY ACADEMY: Standards Based Grading is used at NeoCity Academy as a way to help students see the correlation between the expected outcomes and the work products they are creating. It keeps in mind that learning is a process and, like any process, needs opportunities to engage it with repeatedly, always trying to get better. At NeoCity Academy, standards based grading allows us to do this. A grade is never final the first attempt. The score on the proficiency scale below is where a student is at in the moment (and they may not be proficient the first time). We understand that learning is a process and so we use reassessments to help students move back to proficient, through working alongside a teacher and revising the content gaps in their original submission. This process is further detailed in the Standards Based Grading Handbook at the bottom of this page.
